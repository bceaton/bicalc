# Introduction to bicalc
This section of the markdown file introduces the main three functions in bicalc. 

## Generating some data
Let's assume that you have recorded 200 individual b-axis measurements from stones on the surface of a gravel bed. We could enter those values in a variable called `diameters` (do so if you wish), or we could simply generate some randomly.
```{r, random_diameters, echo=TRUE}
diameters = 2^rnorm(200, mean = 5, sd = 1)   #generate some log-normally distributed random numbers
head(diameters)   #print the first few data points to the console
```

Now that we have some data to work with, we can use it to generate a cumulative frequency distribution of grain sizes. the function `MakeCFD` is used for this purpose.
```{r, wrangle_data, echo=TRUE}
  test.cfd = MakeCFD(diameters)
  head(test.cfd)   #print the CFD to the console
```
You can enter your own cumulative frequency data, but please ensure that it has the same format and variable names as the output generated by the code shown above.

## Estimating the confidence bounds 
Once we have the cumulative frequency distribution and the number of observations upon which it is based, we can calculate the confidence intervals about the estimate of any given percentile in the distribution. The function we use for this is `WolmanCI`, named in honour of the Reds Wolman, who first described the commonly used method of bed surface sampling used by many people today. Below, we use the function to estimate the $D_{50}$ of the surface, and the 95% confidence bounds for that estimate.

```{r}
D50.estimate = WolmanCI(cfd = test.cfd, n = 200, probs = c(0.5))
D50.estimate   #print the results for D50 to the console

```

We can also do with for multiple percentiles of interest as follows.

```{r}
D.estimates = WolmanCI(cfd = test.cfd, n = 200, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
D.estimates   #print the results for D25, D50 and D75 to the console

```

## Plotting the confidence intervals
let's begin by first generating a conventional grain size distribution plot, then adding a polygon representing the confidence interval for the entire distribution. The polygon that includes the upper and lower estimates for each percentile in the distribution is created using `PolyCI`. 

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}  
  
#  create the standard plot using base graphics
  plot(test.cfd,  
     type ="b",
     pch = 21,
     log = "x",
     col = rgb(0,0,1,0.35),
     ylim = c(0, 1),
     xlab = "grain size (mm)",
     ylab = "Proportion Finer"
     )

#  create the confidence interval polygon
test.poly = PolyCI(cfd = test.cfd, n = 200, alpha = 0.05)

#  add it to the basic plot
polygon(test.poly, col = rgb(0,0,1,0.2), lty = 0)
```
