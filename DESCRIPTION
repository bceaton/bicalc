Description: This package uses binomial theory to estimate confidence intervals for the percentiles of gravel bed river bed surfaces. To use this technique, the user must have a cumulative frequency of the bed surface, and they must know how many individual measurements were taken in order to create the frequency distribution. The package also contains tools that can be used to create cumulative frequency distributions using measurements of individual grain sizes.
